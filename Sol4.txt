In object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, self is a conventionally used parameter name that refers to the instance (object) of a class within the class's methods. It is a way to refer to the object itself and access its attributes and methods.

The use of self is crucial in OOP because it allows objects to maintain their own state and behavior. When a method is called on an object, self is automatically passed as the first argument to that method. By convention, the parameter name self is used, but you can choose any name you prefer (although it is recommended to stick with the convention to improve code readability).
